# Drum_player
This Drum Kit Project is an interactive web-based application that plays different drum sounds when specific words or buttons on the screen are clicked. The project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a visually appealing and functional drum kit experience that responds to user interactions.

# Features
Interactive Buttons: Each button on the screen is labeled with a word, and clicking on a button triggers a unique drum sound.
Responsive Design: The application is styled with CSS to look great on various devices and screen sizes.
Sound Integration: Uses JavaScript to play preloaded drum sounds when the corresponding button is clicked or a key is pressed on the keyboard.
Animations: Visual feedback, such as button highlighting, is provided when a sound is played to enhance the user experience.
# How It Works
HTML Structure: The page contains a series of buttons, each representing a drum component or sound (e.g., "Kick", "Snare", "Hi-Hat").
CSS Styling: The buttons are styled for a modern and engaging appearance.
JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript is used to listen for click events on each button and keypress events on the keyboard. When an event is triggered, the corresponding sound is played using the Audio object in JavaScript.
